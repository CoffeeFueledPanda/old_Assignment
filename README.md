# Pest Control Landing Page

##### *(Old assignment)*

An old assignment that I got to do for an IT firm, it's a mock-up for a business landing page, uploading it for safe-keeping and to improve it further, since it was made during my early developing days. All the images and any/all identifiers have been replaced with free-creative common ones, the name has also been changed and is fictional and is in no way, shape nor form affiliated with any business or organization.
